## React Hooks Simple Login App

This simple ReactJS login form has been developed to show how React Hooks can make functional components control state, negating the need to write complex class components.
I followed a tutorial to learn how these new features of ReactJS work, however I refactored where possible, trying to put my own stamp on project.

The Login credentials are:-

```
Username: Matt
```

```
Password: password
```
